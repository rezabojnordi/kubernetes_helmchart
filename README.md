Sure! Here's a polished, professional example of a README section for a Helm chart that guides someone on installation, dependencies, and usage:

---

# My Helm Chart

This Helm chart helps you deploy **\[Your Application Name]** easily on Kubernetes. It includes all necessary configurations and supports customization through values.

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.20+
* Helm 3.0+
* Access to a Kubernetes cluster

## Installing the Chart

Add the repository (if applicable):

```bash
helm repo add my-repo https://example.com/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Install the chart:

```bash
helm install my-release my-repo/my-chart
```

> Replace `my-release` with a name for your deployment.

## Installing Dependencies

If the chart has dependencies defined in `Chart.yaml`, run:

```bash
helm dependency update
```

This ensures all required charts are downloaded before installation.

## Customizing the Chart

You can customize the chart by modifying the `values.yaml` file or passing overrides via the command line:

```bash
helm install my-release my-repo/my-chart --values custom-values.yaml
```

Or override individual values:

```bash
helm install my-release my-repo/my-chart --set image.tag=1.2.3
```

## Upgrading the Chart

```bash
helm upgrade my-release my-repo/my-chart --values custom-values.yaml
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

```bash
helm uninstall my-release
```

## Notes

* Ensure you have configured all required secrets or config maps if your chart depends on them.
* Check the `values.yaml` for all configurable options.
